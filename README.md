    Hey ThereðŸ‘‹<br>

  <b>About me:</b><br>
  I was originally a web developer(<b>HTML+CSS only</b>) who did some OOP based programming through C++(at 10yrs age) <br>
  but later my life changed in COVID-19.<br><br>
  Though I had completed 5 languages by the age of 12 but... <br>
  <b>real learning started in COVID-19</b>,<br>
  That was the biggest boon ever<br>
  I had completed more than 13 languages just in a year and few more months.<br><br>
  <u>I'm not gonna write whole story cuz it contains many turning points<u><br><br>
  Well the reason behind 13 was that I was 13yrs old and really that was a great experience.<br>
  I'm 15yrs currently in 2022 but my curiosity led me to learn 17 languages, so I'm at a <b>Pause currently</b>!<br>
  Focusing on 'gaining XP' and 'development' + I'm 15yrs so 'Schooling' also!
